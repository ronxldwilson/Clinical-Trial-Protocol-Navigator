As per ADA guidelines, The diagnosis [of T2DM] is made onthe basis of the confirmed test.Moreover, because HbA1c has been shown to be higher in African Americans (AA) ascompared to other races for the same glycemia, AA who do not have diabetes may beunfairly excluded by their HbA1c alone 96-98. Therefore, for AA subjects, if theirfasting and 2h glucose is in the non-diabetes range, and the HbA1c is < 7.0%, wewill consider them not to have diabetes.4. Recent or regular use of colchicine, anorexiant, or diabetic medications in the last3 months, or plan to start in the following 3 months.5. Recent or regular use of anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. prednisone, NSAIDs) inthe last 7 days, or plan to start in the following 3 months.6. Current use of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), asthis may cause a significant increase in colchicine plasma concentrations and riskfor side effects. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided thecontraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting studymedication.

    "raw_inclusion": "Inclusion criteria are a) presence of PAD; b) BMI> 25 kg/m2; c) Age >= 18. The diagnosisof PAD will be based on the following. First, an ankle brachial index (ABI) value <=0.90, which is a well-accepted standard for diagnosing PAD. People with a toe brachialindex of <=0.70, performed at the study visit, will be eligible. Second, people with anABI of >0.90 and <=1.00 who experience a 20% or greater drop in ABI in either leg afterthe heel-rise test will also be included. Third, potential participants with an ABI >0.90 who provide vascular laboratory evidence or angiographic evidence of PAD will beincluded. Prior vascular laboratory evidence consists of objective evidence of PADincluding toe brachial index (TBI) < 0.70, Duplex measure showing 70% stenosis orgreater, a post-exercise ABI drop in either leg of 20% or greater, or ABI values <= 0.90.Angiographic evidence of PAD consists of a stenosis of 70% or greater in a lowerextremity artery. Fourth, people with a history of lower extremity revascularization whodo not meet the criterion above and have an ABI > 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABIafter an exercise test will be eligible if they have symptomatic PAD. Symptomatic PADwill be defined as leg symptoms associated with exertion that resolved within 10 minutesof rest. The presence of symptomatic PAD will be determined based on the claudicationquestionnaire, the six-minute walk, or principal investigator interview/discussion withthe potential participant. The post-exercise ABI drop will be measured by obtaining anABI, having the participant exercise, and then immediately repeating the ABI. Theexercise may consist of either the six-minute walk test or the heel-rise test. Theheel-rise test consists of 50 heel rises at a rate of one per second. From the beginningof the trial until early 2023, we used the BMI inclusion criterion of > 28 kg/m2 becauseoverweight and obesity are defined as a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 and > 30 kg/m2,respectively, and because in our PAD cohorts, those with BMI > 28 kg/m2 havesignificantly greater functional impairment and faster functional decline than those withBMI of 20-28 kg/m2. In order to increase the rate of recruitment, on 1/19/2022,investigators reduced the BMI inclusion criterion to > 25 kg/ m2. People with BMI above25 are overweight or obese and therefore are expected to benefit from the healthylifestyle intervention.Exclusion Criteria:1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, or wheelchair confinement.2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.3. Failure to complete the study run-in, defined as not entering at least 800 Kcal ofconsumed calories per day for at least five days during the 14-day run-in*.4. Major surgery, coronary or leg revascularization in the past 3 months or anticipatedin the next year.5. Experienced a heart attack or stroke in the past 3 months.6. Major medical illness including lung disease requiring oxygen or life-threateningillness, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy lessthan six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an earlystage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent.7. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score < 23, dementia and substance abuse.Potential participants with an MMSE score of less than 23 may be eligible if theprincipal investigator determines that their lower score is due to reasons otherthan poor cognition. Other potential reasons for lower scores include poor literacyor that English is not their first language.8. History of being treated for new onset or an acute episode of schizophrenia orpsychosis in the past 6 months.9. Hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder in the past 6 months. 10. BMI > 45 kg/m2 11. History of a significant eating disorder that has been active within the past 5years or any weight loss treatment in the past 6 months. Weight loss treatmentincludes weight watchers, any history of weight loss surgery, and using weight lossmedications now or in the past six months. 12. Weight gain or loss of more than 25 pounds in the past six months 13. Potential participants unwilling/unable to use a smart phone and unwilling to attendweekly study sessions. 14. Excessive alcohol use, defined as >14 drinks/week in men and > 10 alcoholicdrinks/week in women. 15. Current ulcer on bottom of foot 16. Current participation in supervised treadmill exercise, participation in supervisedtreadmill exercise in the past three months, or planning to participate insupervised treadmill exercise in the next year 17. Increase in angina or angina at rest. Potential participants may become eligiblefollowing an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of anabsence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician. 18. Non-English speaking 19. Visual impairment that limits walking ability 20. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level comparable to the amount ofexercise prescribed in the intervention 21. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.[NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants willbecome eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or genetherapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the finalintervention administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (otherthan stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final studyfollow-up visit as long as at least three months have passed since the finalintervention of the trial.] 22. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determineif the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant-The run-in will also be used to assist participants with learning the app.However, they must demonstrate ability to enter at least 800 Kcal per day forat least five days of the run-in.",

Obese, defined as BMI =30 kg/m2 for patients =16 years of age or weight >97th percentile for age and sex on growth chart assessment for patients 6 to 15 years of age.4. Study participant and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the Investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and is able to understand and sign the written informed consent/assent.5. Female participants of child-bearing potential must be confirmed non-pregnant and agree to use contraception as outlined in the protocol. Female participants of non-childbearing potential, defined as: surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation), post-menopausal for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal lab range), or failure to have progressed to Tanner Stage V and/or failure to have achieved menarche, do not require contraception during the study.6. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a double barrier method contraception if they become sexually active during the study or within 90 days following their participation in the study. Male patients must also not donate sperm during and for 90 days following their participation in the study. Exclusion Criteria:1. Recent intensive (within 2 months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without the use of weight loss agents (including herbal medications) that has resulted in >2% weight loss. These patients may be reconsidered approximately 1 month after cessation of such intensive regimens.2. Current or prior (within prior 2 months) use of any medication, including those approved to treat obesity, that could impact the efficacy results of this study (eg, orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, liraglutide). Patients on a stable dose and regimen (for at least 2 months) of medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be enrolled in the study as long as they agree to remain on the same dose and regimen during the study.3. Prior gastric bypass surgery resulting in >10% weight loss durably maintained from the baseline pre-operative weight with no evidence of weight regain. Specifically, patients may be considered if surgery was not successful, resulted in <10% weight loss compared to pre-operative baseline weight, or there is clear evidence of weight regain after an initial response to bariatric surgery. All patients with a history of bariatric surgery must be discussed with, and receive approval from, the Sponsor prior to enrollment.4. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) disorders that the Investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance. Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be disqualifying as long as an appropriate guardian able to give consent has been appointed.5. In patients with no significant neurocognitive deficits:-A PHQ-9 score of =15 and/or-Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS, any lifetime history of a suicide attempt, or any suicidal behavior in the last month.6. Current, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac, or oncologic disease considered severe enough to interfere with the study and/or confound the results. Any patient with a potentially clinically significant disease should be reviewed with the Sponsor to determine eligibility.7. History of significant liver disease or liver injury, or a current liver assessment due to abnormal liver tests (as indicated by abnormal liver function tests, alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin >1.5x the upper limit of normal [ULN] for any of these tests) for an etiology other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, any underlying etiology besides NAFLD, including diagnosed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), other causes of hepatitis, or history of hepatic cirrhosis is exclusionary, but the presence of NAFLD is not be exclusionary.8. Moderate to severe renal dysfunction defined as <30 mL/min (Appendix 11.6).9. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), or patient history of ocular-cutaneous albinism.10. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as part of comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified dermatologist during screening. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening period will be biopsied and results must be known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient should be excluded from the study.11. Patient is, in the opinion of the Study Investigator, not suitable to participate in the study.12.

A second primarycaregiver and other family members can also participate.2. Must eat =3 family dinner meals per week. Research shows that youth who have morethan three family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later. Thus,families who report three or fewer family meals per week will be recruited tooptimize the potential for change in family meal frequency. Families will focus onthe family dinner in the intervention to improve their family meal quality andquantity. This decision is based on: (1) Family Systems Theory, which indicates thatchange in one setting (e.g., family dinner) will generalize to other settings (e.g.,breakfast, lunch, snacks).3. Child with age and sex adjusted BMI =75th percentile (no upper limit).4. One of the following race/ethnicities: African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latino,Native American, Asian American, or White. In order to examine racial/ethnicdifferences in study hypotheses, equal numbers of children per racial/ethnic group(total=500) will be recruited.5. Parent and family members who speak English or Spanish.6. Not expected to move within the next two years.STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIAThe exclusionary criteria used to exclude participants from the proposed study includes:1. Children with medically necessary dietary restrictions (reviewed by MD from primarycare clinics).2. Non-custodial parents, who the child does not live with more than 50% of the time.",

    "raw_inclusion": "-IINCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIACRITERIA FOR INCLUSION:Ethnicity: BlackThis is a study of adult African Americans and Blacks that were born in Africa but arenow living in the United States. As African American people are multi-ethnic, we will inthis initial investigation, study two different groups of African American. To enrollparticipants must self-identify as African Americans and be born in the United States,with American born parents or be born in Africa with African born parents. In both groupswe will study sex differences in the role of obesity and TG levels on cardiovasculardisease. In the future, we plan to expand the study to include other groups whichself-identify as African Americans (i.e.AfroCarribeans and Hispanic blacks).Only blacks are included in this study because the focus of this study is on genderdifferences in blacks in risk factors for CAD, specifically obesity, TG levels and TGrelated CAD risk factors. Unlike Caucasian women, premenopausal black women do not appearto be as protected from heart disease as a result of their gender. One model to studythis apparent decrease in genderrelated cardioprotection in black women is to compare black men to black women. Analternative model would be to compare black women to Caucasian women. However, since theprimary focus of this work is on gender differences rather than racial differencescomparing black women to men is a superior model. Other racial groups do not share theloss of gender-related cardioprotection found in blacks, and have been excluded. Furtherthe advantage of comparing black men and women is that this comparison provides a bettercontrol of dietary, cultural and genetic factors.Age: The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 70 years. As stated in theoriginal protocol on page 14: Future investigations are planned which will involvesimilar comparisons between premenopausal and postmenopausal black women and betweenwhites and blacks. To investigate risk for glucose intolerance, diabetes andcardiovascular risk factors, it is no longer sufficient to maintain the age range between18 and 50 years. We need to expand to an age range with an increased prevalence of theserisk factors.Medical History: To participate in the study subjects should identify themselves ashealthy. This is important so the broadest possible sample of people will enroll. Thefact that people are healthy will be confirmed by the history, physical and laboratorytests done as part of the screening visit. People with established coronary artery asevidenced by history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or PTCAwill be allowed to participate if they are not currently having angina.CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION:Black Ethnicity other than American or African.As stated in the inclusion criteria black people are a multi-ethnic group. In thisinitial investigation we are focusing on African Americans who are American born andAfricans living in the United States who are African born. In the future, we will expandthe study to include other groups of blacks such as individuals of Afro-Caribbean andHispanic blacks.Medications: People who take medications that are known to alter the parameters which areunder investigation in this study will be excluded. People taking medications to treathyperlipidemia will be included but analyses will be adjusted to take this into account.Subjects on thyroid hormone replacement will be included if their TSH is normal.Diabetes: Because diabetes affects insulin sensitivity and TG levels all people withdiabetes even if the diabetes is controlled with diet alone will not be enrolled in thestudy.Pregnant or Breastfeeding: Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have an infant thatis less than four months of age will be excluded. This is because the physiologic changesassociated with pregnancy, breastfeeding or recent childbirth affect the parameters understudy.Menstrual History: Now that postmenopausal women are included, menstrual history will betaken but women with irregular menses and hysterectomy will not be excluded. Womenbetween the ages of 40 and 55 years will have FSH checked for proper characterization.Women 56 years of age and older will be assumed to be postmenopausal. However, women onany type of injectable hormonal contraception will be excluded because hormonalcontraception affects both TG levels and glucose metabolism.",

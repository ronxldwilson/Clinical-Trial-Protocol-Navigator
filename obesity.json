The sessions will be offered virtually to increase accessibility and address participant safety concerns about travelling alone in the evenings. The DPP sessions will be led by a trained certified diabetes care and education specialist, dietitian, exercise physiologist, and trained peer educators using materials from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). The goal of the educational group sessions is to bring the grandmothers together so they can offer each other support by sharing their experiences and knowledge with each other. The sessions are designed to empower participants to improve health and reduce diabetes risk through healthy behaviors. This message will be reinforced throughout the program where grandmothers will be encouraged to appreciate various aspects of health in a comprehensive manner.Nutritional education with a focus on the development of healthy eating behaviors that are sustainable throughout life is a key aspect of DPP. Rather than promoting caloric restriction, the nutrition sessions will focus on the importance of eating breakfast, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, reducing calories from fat and added sugar, portion control, and healthy snacking.<br><br>Grandmothers will be allocated in a 2:1 ratio to the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (active comparator) or DPP + HOPE (intervention) to account for anticipated attrition in the DPP arm.

				"Inclusion_Criteria": "There are five eligibility criteria for participation in this study. Values for each ofthe eligibility criteria will be based on self-report by the potential participant.Potential participants who do not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria will beinformed that they are ineligible for the study and then will be taken to the exit pagefrom the PAS website (http://pasintervention.com/login).-The first criterion is being between 18 and 64 years old, consistent withevidence-based age groupings for global recommendations on physical activity forhealth.-The second criterion is a body mass index (BMI) = 25.00 kg/m2, consistent with manyphysical activity interventions in adults with obesity. A justification for thiscriterion is the need to promote physical activity in a BMI-based population inwhich few individuals may meet public health guidelines for physical activity.-The third criterion is the ability to access the online intervention. This criterionwill be assessed by asking them to confirm that they will have access to atechnological device (e.g., computer, smart phone) that can access the onlineintervention via a web browser.-The fourth criterion is a willingness to comply with instructions for physicalactivity monitoring. This criterion will be assessed by asking them if they arewilling to wear a physical activity monitor on their waist for two 7-day intervalsand complete a daily log sheet regarding wear time during each of the two 7-dayintervals in the study. A justification for this criterion is based on previousstudies where a similar question was asked to potential participants at screening.Those who indicate a willingness to comply with instructions for physical activitymonitoring will be asked to provide information about their non-dominant hand.-The final criterion is a willingness to respond to study-related contacts (e.g.,email, text message, phone call). A justification for this criterion is thatparticipants will be asked to complete some tasks in a specifically structuredschedule.",

BMI percentile will be calculated from age- and sex-specific growth charts for children.-NAFLD status: The NAFLD group participants will be eligible if they are scheduled for liver biopsy for clinical reasons and their histopathology report confirms a diagnosis of NAFLD. NW control, and Ob control, and Liver control participants must not have diagnosed NAFLD. Exclusion Criteria:-Chronic illness: Participants will not be able to participate if they have conditions that are likely to affect metabolic variables (either directly or due to required medications) or result in them being unable to complete the required tests. Such conditions could include, but are not limited to, untreated hypothyroidism or other endocrine disorders, rheumatoid arthritis requiring steroids or limiting mobility, cardiovascular disease, stroke, or cardiac failure, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, liver diseases other than NAFLD (e.g., Wilson's disease), other organ disorders, or orthopedic conditions that limit physical activity.-Acute illness: Participants will not be able to participate if they develop acute conditions that are likely to affect metabolic outcomes (either directly or due to required medications) or result in them being unable to participate; e.g., respiratory illness, infectious disease, fever, accident resulting in bone fractures, myocardial infarction, major depression. If such conditions resolve and there are no longer risks or likelihood of adverse effect on the study outcomes, participants may be rescheduled for testing.-Medications and nutritional supplements: Medications, vitamins, or supplements that have known effects on the primary outcomes will be cause for exclusion. Examples include weight loss medications, glucocorticoids, or experimental medications used to correct a metabolic or hepatic condition. Medications used to control asthma, allergies, anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder, menstrual cycle, hypothyroidism, gastric reflux, hypertension, and sleep will be allowed. Participants who are taking medications for treatment of acute illness or conditions such as cold, flu, injury, or infection will be rescheduled after they complete their treatment course.-Pregnancy: Evidence of pregnancy or intent to become pregnant during the study is cause for exclusion.-Smoking, alcohol abuse, or illicit drug abuse: Participants who smoke or have signs or symptoms of alcohol or substance abuse will be excluded.",

HOMA-IR >= 2.6 mg/L, calculated as fasting glucose (in mg/dL) x insulin in(microIU/mL/ 405). Our goal is to enroll participants who have pre-existing insulinresistance.7. hsCRP >= 2.0 mg/L. We aim to recruit participants with increased baseline level ofinflammation. Individuals with hsCRP above 2.0 mg/L have been shown to have anincreased risk for cardiovascular events.8. Willing to be randomized (willing and able to give consent/assent as required forrandomized study).Participants who will be evaluated but are not eligible for randomization (EvaluationOnly Arm) must meet all of the following Inclusion Criteria:1. Good general health. In general subjects should take no medications. The use ofover-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed on a case-by-casebasis; depending on the medication, subjects who have continued to take prescriptionmedication or have stopped taking an exclusionary medication for at least 3 monthsprior to study entry may still be eligible.2. Age >= 18y3. BMI >= 18 kg/m24. Weight <= 450 lbs (204.5 kg)5. For females of reproductive potential: use of highly effective contraception for atleast 1 month prior to screening and agreement to use such a method during studyparticipation6. Willing and able to provide consent for Evaluation-Only studyEXCLUSION CRITERIA:All individuals meeting any of the exclusion criteria at screening or baseline will beexcluded from study participation.Exclusion Criteria for subject randomized to colchicine or placebo:1. Individuals with significant medical comorbidities (e.g., NYHA Class III or IV heartfailure, or CKD Stage 3b or worse (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), or American Society ofAnesthesiologists Physical Status Class 3 or above) or other serious disorders atthe discretion of the investigators.2. HbA1c > 7.0%3. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, as determined by either having:1. clear clinical diagnosis of diabetes, such as a patient in a hyperglycemiccrisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose >= 200mg/dL2. two of the following three:i. fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dLii. Hemoglobin A1c >= 6.5%iii. An oral glucose tolerance test glucose concentration of >= 200 mg/dL at 2hours.c. one of the above three criteria (bi.-biii.) meeting the T2DM cutoff on twodifferent days.If only one of the above three criteria (bi.-biii.) meet the T2DM threshold duringthe Screening Visit, that test will be repeated on another day to determine if thesubject has T2DM or not. As per ADA guidelines, The diagnosis [of T2DM] is made onthe basis of the confirmed test.Moreover, because HbA1c has been shown to be higher in African Americans (AA) ascompared to other races for the same glycemia, AA who do not have diabetes may beunfairly excluded by their HbA1c alone 96-98. Therefore, for AA subjects, if theirfasting and 2h glucose is in the non-diabetes range, and the HbA1c is < 7.0%, wewill consider them not to have diabetes.4. Recent or regular use of colchicine, anorexiant, or diabetic medications in the last3 months, or plan to start in the following 3 months.5. Recent or regular use of anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. prednisone, NSAIDs) inthe last 7 days, or plan to start in the following 3 months.6. Current use of a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor or P-glycoprotein (P-gp), asthis may cause a significant increase in colchicine plasma concentrations and riskfor side effects. Oral contraceptive use will be permitted, provided thecontraceptive has been used for at least two months before starting studymedication. Note: HMA-CoA reductase inhibitors ( statins ) in adults only will alsobeexplicitly allowed because of the recent clinical trial data finding it is safe toadminister low-dose colchicine even with high-dose statin therapy. The use ofover-the-counter and prescription medications will be reviewed on a case-by-casebasis; depending on the medication, subjects who have continued to take prescriptionmedication or have stopped taking an exclusionary medication for at least 3 monthsprior to study entry may be eligible.7. Known allergy to colchicine.8. Previous history of agranulocytosis, gout, or significant myositis.9. Females who are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, currently nursing an infant,or have irregular menses, defined as cycles less than 21 days or greater than 45days in premenopausal women. 10. Individuals who have current substance abuse or a DSM 5 Axis I psychiatric disorderor DSM Axis II Mental Retardation diagnosis that in the opinion of the investigatorswould impede competence, compliance, or participation in the study. 11. Current users of tobacco or nicotine (e.g., nicotine patch, e-cigarettes) products. 12. Participation in a formal weight loss program (e.g., Weight Watchers) or recentweight change of more than 3% of body weight in the past two months.Exclusion Criteria for subjects who are evaluated but not eligible for randomization(Evaluation Only Arm):We will use the same exclusion criteria as employed for randomized participants (seeabove).",

				"Inclusion_Criteria": "Inclusion criteria are a) presence of PAD; b) BMI> 25 kg/m2; c) Age >= 18. The diagnosisof PAD will be based on the following. First, an ankle brachial index (ABI) value <=0.90, which is a well-accepted standard for diagnosing PAD. People with a toe brachialindex of <=0.70, performed at the study visit, will be eligible. Second, people with anABI of >0.90 and <=1.00 who experience a 20% or greater drop in ABI in either leg afterthe heel-rise test will also be included. Third, potential participants with an ABI >0.90 who provide vascular laboratory evidence or angiographic evidence of PAD will beincluded. Prior vascular laboratory evidence consists of objective evidence of PADincluding toe brachial index (TBI) < 0.70, Duplex measure showing 70% stenosis orgreater, a post-exercise ABI drop in either leg of 20% or greater, or ABI values <= 0.90.Angiographic evidence of PAD consists of a stenosis of 70% or greater in a lowerextremity artery. Fourth, people with a history of lower extremity revascularization whodo not meet the criterion above and have an ABI > 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABIafter an exercise test will be eligible if they have symptomatic PAD. Symptomatic PADwill be defined as leg symptoms associated with exertion that resolved within 10 minutesof rest. The presence of symptomatic PAD will be determined based on the claudicationquestionnaire, the six-minute walk, or principal investigator interview/discussion withthe potential participant. The post-exercise ABI drop will be measured by obtaining anABI, having the participant exercise, and then immediately repeating the ABI. Theexercise may consist of either the six-minute walk test or the heel-rise test. Theheel-rise test consists of 50 heel rises at a rate of one per second. From the beginningof the trial until early 2023, we used the BMI inclusion criterion of > 28 kg/m2 becauseoverweight and obesity are defined as a BMI of 25 to 29 kg/m2 and > 30 kg/m2,respectively, and because in our PAD cohorts, those with BMI > 28 kg/m2 havesignificantly greater functional impairment and faster functional decline than those withBMI of 20-28 kg/m2. In order to increase the rate of recruitment, on 1/19/2022,investigators reduced the BMI inclusion criterion to > 25 kg/ m2. People with BMI above25 are overweight or obese and therefore are expected to benefit from the healthylifestyle intervention.Exclusion Criteria:1. Above or below knee amputation, critical limb ischemia, or wheelchair confinement.2. Walking is limited by a condition other than PAD.3. Failure to complete the study run-in, defined as not entering at least 800 Kcal ofconsumed calories per day for at least five days during the 14-day run-in*.4. Major surgery, coronary or leg revascularization in the past 3 months or anticipatedin the next year.5. Experienced a heart attack or stroke in the past 3 months.6. Major medical illness including lung disease requiring oxygen or life-threateningillness, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy lessthan six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an earlystage cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent.7. Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score < 23, dementia and substance abuse.Potential participants with an MMSE score of less than 23 may be eligible if theprincipal investigator determines that their lower score is due to reasons otherthan poor cognition. Other potential reasons for lower scores include poor literacyor that English is not their first language.8. History of being treated for new onset or an acute episode of schizophrenia orpsychosis in the past 6 months.9. Hospitalization for a psychiatric disorder in the past 6 months. 10. BMI > 45 kg/m2 11. History of a significant eating disorder that has been active within the past 5years or any weight loss treatment in the past 6 months. Weight loss treatmentincludes weight watchers, any history of weight loss surgery, and using weight lossmedications now or in the past six months. 12. Weight gain or loss of more than 25 pounds in the past six months 13. Potential participants unwilling/unable to use a smart phone and unwilling to attendweekly study sessions. 14. Excessive alcohol use, defined as >14 drinks/week in men and > 10 alcoholicdrinks/week in women. 15. Current ulcer on bottom of foot 16. Current participation in supervised treadmill exercise, participation in supervisedtreadmill exercise in the past three months, or planning to participate insupervised treadmill exercise in the next year 17. Increase in angina or angina at rest. Potential participants may become eligiblefollowing an abnormal baseline treadmill stress test if they have evidence of anabsence of coronary ischemia based on testing with their own physician. 18. Non-English speaking 19. Visual impairment that limits walking ability 20. Currently walking regularly for exercise at a level comparable to the amount ofexercise prescribed in the intervention 21. Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.[NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants willbecome eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or genetherapy study so long as at least six months have passed since the finalintervention administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (otherthan stem cell or gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final studyfollow-up visit as long as at least three months have passed since the finalintervention of the trial.] 22. In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determineif the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant-The run-in will also be used to assist participants with learning the app.However, they must demonstrate ability to enter at least 800 Kcal per day forat least five days of the run-in.",

				"Intervention": "<br> Our project has two arms, the Shared Decisions Making (SDM) and Usual Decision Making (UDM).<br><br> Shared Decision Making combines subject preferences with evidence-based medicine in a collaborative conversation to help the person determine their optimal treatment approach.In SDM, both parties share information: the clinician offers options and describes their risks and benefits, and the patient expresses his or her preferences and values. Each participant is thus armed with a better understanding of the relevant factors and shares responsibility in the decision about how to proceed. This is a process of open communication or mutually acceptable decision. In this project the research staff will offer to participant personalized information about treatment and prevention options and their associated risks and benefits. The participant then should communicate to the staff his or her values, preferences and concerns related to these variables. The goal is to arrive at a joint decision regarding the best strategy. Patients will be informed, more likely to comply with the plan and more likely to be satisfied with their outcome.<br><br> The Usual Decision Making (UDM) intervention or traditional biomedical care system will be the control group in this study.<br><br> 600 participants from the ambulatory clinic at the Lincoln Hospital will be recruited and randomized into 2 groups,the Shared Decision Making (SDM) and Usual Decision Making (UDM) to test the effectiveness of interventions using SDM in changing participants health habits, compared to usual education and decision making (UDM).The overall goal of this study is to decrease the cardiovascular risk among the ambulatory clinic patients by utilizing a SDM intervention m",

				"Inclusion_Criteria": "<br> Inclusion Criteria:1. BBS clinical diagnosis as per Beales, 1999 (with either 4 primary features or 3 primary and 2 secondary features) Or AS diagnosis as per Marshall, 2007 (using major and minor age adjusted criteria).2. Greater than or equal to =6 years of age.3. Obese, defined as BMI =30 kg/m2 for patients =16 years of age or weight >97th percentile for age and sex on growth chart assessment for patients 6 to 15 years of age.4. Study participant and/or parent or guardian is able to communicate well with the Investigator, to understand and comply with the requirements of the study, and is able to understand and sign the written informed consent/assent.5. Female participants of child-bearing potential must be confirmed non-pregnant and agree to use contraception as outlined in the protocol. Female participants of non-childbearing potential, defined as: surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral tubal ligation), post-menopausal for at least 12 months (and confirmed with a screening follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal lab range), or failure to have progressed to Tanner Stage V and/or failure to have achieved menarche, do not require contraception during the study.6. Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a double barrier method contraception if they become sexually active during the study or within 90 days following their participation in the study. Male patients must also not donate sperm during and for 90 days following their participation in the study. Exclusion Criteria:1. Recent intensive (within 2 months) diet and/or exercise regimen with or without the use of weight loss agents (including herbal medications) that has resulted in >2% weight loss. These patients may be reconsidered approximately 1 month after cessation of such intensive regimens.2. Current or prior (within prior 2 months) use of any medication, including those approved to treat obesity, that could impact the efficacy results of this study (eg, orlistat, lorcaserin, phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, liraglutide). Patients on a stable dose and regimen (for at least 2 months) of medication to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be enrolled in the study as long as they agree to remain on the same dose and regimen during the study.3. Prior gastric bypass surgery resulting in >10% weight loss durably maintained from the baseline pre-operative weight with no evidence of weight regain. Specifically, patients may be considered if surgery was not successful, resulted in <10% weight loss compared to pre-operative baseline weight, or there is clear evidence of weight regain after an initial response to bariatric surgery. All patients with a history of bariatric surgery must be discussed with, and receive approval from, the Sponsor prior to enrollment.4. Diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorder or other Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-V) disorders that the Investigator believes will interfere significantly with study compliance. Neurocognitive disorders affecting ability to consent will not be disqualifying as long as an appropriate guardian able to give consent has been appointed.5. In patients with no significant neurocognitive deficits:-A PHQ-9 score of =15 and/or-Any suicidal ideation of type 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS, any lifetime history of a suicide attempt, or any suicidal behavior in the last month.6. Current, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac, or oncologic disease considered severe enough to interfere with the study and/or confound the results. Any patient with a potentially clinically significant disease should be reviewed with the Sponsor to determine eligibility.7. History of significant liver disease or liver injury, or a current liver assessment due to abnormal liver tests (as indicated by abnormal liver function tests, alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin >1.5x the upper limit of normal [ULN] for any of these tests) for an etiology other than non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Thus, any underlying etiology besides NAFLD, including diagnosed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), other causes of hepatitis, or history of hepatic cirrhosis is exclusionary, but the presence of NAFLD is not be exclusionary.8. Moderate to severe renal dysfunction defined as <30 mL/min (Appendix 11.6).9. History or close family history (parents or siblings) of skin cancer or melanoma (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), or patient history of ocular-cutaneous albinism.10. Significant dermatologic findings relating to melanoma or pre-melanoma skin lesions (excluding non-invasive basal or squamous cell lesion), determined as part of comprehensive skin evaluation performed by a qualified dermatologist during screening. Any concerning lesions identified during the screening period will be biopsied and results must be known to be benign prior to enrollment. If the pre-treatment biopsy results are of concern, the patient should be excluded from the study.11. Patient is, in the opinion of the Study Investigator, not suitable to participate in the study.12. Participation in any clinical study with an investigational drug/device within 3 months prior to the first day of dosing.13. Significant hypersensitivity to study drug.14. Inability to comply with QD injection regimen.",

A second primarycaregiver and other family members can also participate.2. Must eat =3 family dinner meals per week. Research shows that youth who have morethan three family meals per week are less likely to be obese ten years later. Thus,families who report three or fewer family meals per week will be recruited tooptimize the potential for change in family meal frequency. Families will focus onthe family dinner in the intervention to improve their family meal quality andquantity. This decision is based on: (1) Family Systems Theory, which indicates thatchange in one setting (e.g., family dinner) will generalize to other settings (e.g.,breakfast, lunch, snacks).3. Child with age and sex adjusted BMI =75th percentile (no upper limit).4. One of the following race/ethnicities: African American, Asian, Hispanic/Latino,Native American, Asian American, or White. In order to examine racial/ethnicdifferences in study hypotheses, equal numbers of children per racial/ethnic group(total=500) will be recruited.5. Parent and family members who speak English or Spanish.6. Not expected to move within the next two years.STUDY EXCLUSION CRITERIAThe exclusionary criteria used to exclude participants from the proposed study includes:1. Children with medically necessary dietary restrictions (reviewed by MD from primarycare clinics).2. Non-custodial parents, who the child does not live with more than 50% of the time.",

Individuals withuntreated or major illnesses relating to the endocrine and/or cardiovascular systemsare excluded because these illnesses will likely influence outcomes. Suchobesity-related comorbidities include hypertension (defined by age- sex- and height-specific standards; and fasting hyperglycemia consistent with diabetes (fastingglucose > 126 mg/dL).-Presence of other major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, mostendocrinologic (e.g., Cushing syndrome, untreated hyper- or hypothyroidism),hematological problems or pulmonary disorders (other than asthma not requiringcontinuous medication). Non-serious medical illnesses, such as seasonal allergies,will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.-Regular use of any medication known to affect body weight or eating behavior (e.g.,many medications prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD).Medication use for non-serious conditions (e.g., acne) will be considered on acase-by-case basis.-Current pregnancy or a history of pregnancy. A negative pregnancy test beforestarting the study will be required for postmenarcheal girls.-Current and regular use of tobacco products and/or alcohol.-A significant reduction in weight during the past three months, for any reason,exceeding 5% of body weight.-A history of significant or recent brain injury that may considerably influenceperformance on neurocognitive measures (i.e., any history of loss of consciousness>=30 minutes associated with a head injury, any history of memory loss orhospitalization associated with a head injury, or >=2 concussions within last year).-Presence of any significant, full-threshold psychiatric disorder based on DSMcriteria such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, alcohol or substance abuse,anorexia or bulimia nervosa, or any disorder that, in the opinion of theinvestigators, would impede competence or compliance or possibly hinder completionof the study. These individuals will not be permitted to enroll in the current studyand will be referred for treatment. Individuals who present with other psychiatricdisorders, including sub-threshold psychiatric disorders, will be permitted toenroll in the study. Sub-threshold psychiatric disorders include symptoms that donot meet diagnostic threshold based on the DSM criteria for mental disorders, butwhich are nevertheless significantly impairing or distressing. If, based on theopinion of the investigators, a participant requires treatment for his/herpsychiatric symptoms, the individual will be referred for treatment. Participantswho develop any psychiatric disorder or significant psychiatric symptoms at anyfollow-up assessment during the study will not be excluded, but will be providedwith treatment referrals.-Any other condition in the child or parents/guardians that, in the opinion of theinvestigators, would impede compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study(e.g., significant Learning Disorder).Additional exclusions for (optional) stool sample collection include:Stool Sample only:-Diagnosis or history of inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis orCrohn's disease, celiac sprue, irritable bowel syndrome, or other inflammatorydisorders of the intestine.-Diarrhea within 1 week prior to sampling.-Antibiotic use within 4 weeks prior to sampling.In addition, Experiments 1 and 2 have specific additional exclusions:Experiment 1 only:-Regular use of medications that could influence autonomic or endocrine functioning,including alpha and beta blockers, oral contraceptives, or prescription painmedication.-Scoring as \"highly active\" on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (dueto decreased cortisol reactivity).Experiment 2 only:-Participants will be excluded if MRI and MEG is contraindicated (metal in/on body,braces, presence of non-organic [e.g., cochlear] implants or cerebral clips,permanent tattooed makeup or general tattoos that are recent and/or in a dangerouslocation on the body or made with colors whose content in iron cannot be definitelyruled out.-Youth will be excluded if they are left-handed.All participants will receive a written explanation of the purposes, procedures, andpotential hazards of the study. Communication of this information and of theparticipant's assent as well as the consent of the parent or guardian will be documentedin the medical record and copies of all signed documents given to each family.

				"Inclusion_Criteria": "-IINCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIACRITERIA FOR INCLUSION:Ethnicity: BlackThis is a study of adult African Americans and Blacks that were born in Africa but arenow living in the United States. As African American people are multi-ethnic, we will inthis initial investigation, study two different groups of African American. To enrollparticipants must self-identify as African Americans and be born in the United States,with American born parents or be born in Africa with African born parents. In both groupswe will study sex differences in the role of obesity and TG levels on cardiovasculardisease. In the future, we plan to expand the study to include other groups whichself-identify as African Americans (i.e.AfroCarribeans and Hispanic blacks).Only blacks are included in this study because the focus of this study is on genderdifferences in blacks in risk factors for CAD, specifically obesity, TG levels and TGrelated CAD risk factors. Unlike Caucasian women, premenopausal black women do not appearto be as protected from heart disease as a result of their gender. One model to studythis apparent decrease in genderrelated cardioprotection in black women is to compare black men to black women. Analternative model would be to compare black women to Caucasian women. However, since theprimary focus of this work is on gender differences rather than racial differencescomparing black women to men is a superior model. Other racial groups do not share theloss of gender-related cardioprotection found in blacks, and have been excluded. Furtherthe advantage of comparing black men and women is that this comparison provides a bettercontrol of dietary, cultural and genetic factors.Age: The age range of the participants will be between 18 and 70 years. As stated in theoriginal protocol on page 14: Future investigations are planned which will involvesimilar comparisons between premenopausal and postmenopausal black women and betweenwhites and blacks. To investigate risk for glucose intolerance, diabetes andcardiovascular risk factors, it is no longer sufficient to maintain the age range between18 and 50 years. We need to expand to an age range with an increased prevalence of theserisk factors.Medical History: To participate in the study subjects should identify themselves ashealthy. This is important so the broadest possible sample of people will enroll. Thefact that people are healthy will be confirmed by the history, physical and laboratorytests done as part of the screening visit. People with established coronary artery asevidenced by history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery or PTCAwill be allowed to participate if they are not currently having angina.CRITERIA FOR EXCLUSION:Black Ethnicity other than American or African.As stated in the inclusion criteria black people are a multi-ethnic group. In thisinitial investigation we are focusing on African Americans who are American born andAfricans living in the United States who are African born. In the future, we will expandthe study to include other groups of blacks such as individuals of Afro-Caribbean andHispanic blacks.Medications: People who take medications that are known to alter the parameters which areunder investigation in this study will be excluded. People taking medications to treathyperlipidemia will be included but analyses will be adjusted to take this into account.Subjects on thyroid hormone replacement will be included if their TSH is normal.Diabetes: Because diabetes affects insulin sensitivity and TG levels all people withdiabetes even if the diabetes is controlled with diet alone will not be enrolled in thestudy.Pregnant or Breastfeeding: Women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have an infant thatis less than four months of age will be excluded. This is because the physiologic changesassociated with pregnancy, breastfeeding or recent childbirth affect the parameters understudy.Menstrual History: Now that postmenopausal women are included, menstrual history will betaken but women with irregular menses and hysterectomy will not be excluded. Womenbetween the ages of 40 and 55 years will have FSH checked for proper characterization.Women 56 years of age and older will be assumed to be postmenopausal. However, women onany type of injectable hormonal contraception will be excluded because hormonalcontraception affects both TG levels and glucose metabolism.",

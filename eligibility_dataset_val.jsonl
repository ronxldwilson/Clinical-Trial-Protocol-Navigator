Fourth, people with a history of lower extremity revascularization whodo not meet the criterion above and have an ABI > 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in ABIafter an exercise test will be eligible if they have symptomatic PAD. Symptomatic PADwill be defined as leg symptoms associated with exertion that resolved within 10 minutesof rest. The presence of symptomatic PAD will be determined based on the claudicationquestionnaire, the six-minute walk, or principal investigator interview/discussion withthe potential participant. The post-exercise ABI drop will be measured by obtaining anABI, having the participant exercise, and then immediately repeating the ABI. Theexercise may consist of either the six-minute walk test or the heel-rise test. Theheel-rise test consists of 50 heel rises at a rate of one per second.

In order to increase the rate of recruitment, on 1/19/2022,investigators reduced the BMI inclusion criterion to > 25 kg/ m2.
